    <h1>Contribution Guidelines Overview</h1>
    <p>If you would like to become involved in the development of
      Windows Azure SDKs and Tools there are many different ways in
      which you can contribute. We strongly value user feedback and will
      appreciate your questions, bug reports and feature requests. For
      more details how you can submit those see section <a
        href="#feedback">Using the product and providing feedback</a>
      below. In addition you can also contribute changes to the code,
      which include bug fixes and improvements as well as new features.
      For more details how to do this please see section <a
        href="#contributing">Contributing changes</a> below.<br>
    </p>
    <h1 id="feedback">Using the product and providing feedback</h1>
    <p>Using the Windows Azure SDKs and Tools, asking and answering
      question, reporting bugs and making feature requests are critical
      parts of the project community. User feedback is crucial for
      improving the quality of the products and drive further
      development. <br>
      In order to become familiar with the functionality you can
      donwnload the pre-compiled binaries (see <a href="#binaries">Obtaining


        the binaries</a> below) or synch the source code from Github and
      compile locally (see <a href="#sourcecode">Obtaining the source
        code</a> below). Once you become familiar with the functionality
      you can report bugs or request new features (see <a
        href="#bugsandfeatures">Report bugs and request features</a>
      below). <br>
    </p>
    <h2 id="askingquestions">Asking and answering questions</h2>
    <p>The easiest way to ask questions is to use the <a
        href="http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/support/forums/">Windows
        Azure SDK and Tools forums</a> on StackOverflow and MSDN. If
      your target language is .NET the most appropriate forums for
      discussion are on MSDN. For all other languages please use
      StackOverflow.<br>
    </p>
    <h2 id="binaries">Obtaining the binaries<br>
    </h2>
    <p>Pre-compiled binaries of Windows Azure SDK and Tools are
      available on the Windows Azure web site at <a
        href="http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/downloads/">http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/downloads/</a>.
      Select the lnaguage you are interested in (.NET, Node, Java or
      PHP) and click on the Install button.<br>
    </p>
    <h2 id="sourcecode">Obtaining the source code</h2>
    <p>In order to obtain the source code you need to become familiar
      with Git (see <a href="http://progit.org/book/">http://progit.org/book/</a>)
      and Github (see <a href="http://help.github.com/">http://help.github.com/</a>)
      and you need to have Git installed on your local machine. You can
      obtain the source code from Github by following the following
      steps on your local machine:<br>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Go to https://github.com/WindowsAzure/[PROJECT]</li>
      <li>Select <img src="images/button-fork.jpg" alt=""> and choose your own Github account as target</li>
      <li>Clone the repository on your local machine with the following
        Git command<br>
        <code>git clone git@github.com:[USERNAME]/[PROJECT]</code><br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="reportbugs">Report bugs and request features</h2>
    <p>Issues and feature requests are submitted through the project's
      Issues section on GitHub. Please use the following guidelines when
      you submit issues and feature requests:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Make sure the issue is not already reported by searching
        through the list of issues</li>
      <li>Provide detailed description of the issue including the
        following information:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Which feature the issue appears in</li>
        <li>Under what circumstances the issue appears</li>
        <li>What is desired behavior</li>
        <li>What is breaking</li>
        <li>What is the impact (things like loss or corruption of data,
          compromizing security, disruption of service etc.)<br>
        </li>
        <li>Any code that will be helpful to reproduce the issue</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>Issues are regularly reviewed and updated with additional
      information by the core team. Sometimes the core team may have
      questions about particular issue that might need clarifications
      so, please be ready to provide additional information.<br>

    <h2>How to become a contributor?</h2>

      consider your contributions and you will get credit if we do.
      Active contributors might be asked to join the core team, and
      given the ability to merge pull requests. <br>
      You can download the Contributor License Agreement (CLA) by

      </li>
      <li>Update your local repository with the changes from the remote
        repository by using the following Git commands<br>
        <code>git fetch upstream/dev<br>
		git merge upstream/dev
        </code></li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Create bug fixes and features<br>
    </h2>
    <p>You make modifications of the code in your local Git repository.
      Once you are done with your implementation follow the steps below:<br>
    </p>
    <ol>
	  <li>Change the working branch to <code>dev</code> with the following command<br/>
	  <code>git checkout dev</code></li>
      <li>Submit the changes to your own fork in GitHub by using the
        following command<br>
        <code>git submit<br>
        </code></li>
      <li>In GitHub create new pull request by clicking on the Pull
        Request button <img src="images/button-pull-request.jpg" alt=""></li>
      <li>In the pull request select your fork as source and
        WindowsAzure/[PROJECT] as destination for the request</li>
      <li>Write detailed message describing the changes in the pull
        request</li>
      <li>Submit the pull requst for consideration by the Core Team</li>
    </ol>
	<p><strong>Note:</strong> All changes and pull request should be done 
	in the <code>dev</code> branch. Changes will be integrated in the
	<code>master</code> branch by the Core Team.</p>
    <p>Please keep in mind that not all requests will be approved.
      Requests are reviewed by the Core Team on a regular basis and will
      be updated with the status at each review. If your request is
      accepted you will receive information about the next steps and
      when the request will be integrated in the main branch. If your
      request is rejected you will receive information about the reasons
      why it was rejected.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Contribution guidelines</h2>
    <p>Before you start working on bug fixes and features it is good
      idea to discuss those broadly with the community. You can use the
      forums as described in <a href="#askingquestions">Asking and
        answering questions</a> for this purpose.<br>
      Before submitting your changes make sure you followed the
      guidelines below:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>You have properly documented any new functionality using the
        documentation standards for the language (this includes clasees,
        methods and functions, properties etc.)</li>
      <li>For any change you make proper inline documentation is
        included<br>
      </li>
      <li>For any new functionality you have written complete unit tests</li>
      <li>You have ran all unit tests and they pass</li>
    </ul>
	In order to speed up the process of accepting your contributions, you
	should try to make your checkins as small as possible, avoid any unnecessary
	deltas and the need to rebase.
