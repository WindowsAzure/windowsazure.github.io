                    new to <a href="//git-scm.com/">Git</a>, 
                    check out the

                </p>
                <p>
                    We have based our development process for moving code 
                    around on the now-classic 
                    <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">Successful Git Branching Model</a> 
                    as well as using GitHub pull requests and forks between the 
                    central organization repository and developer accounts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From any of the Windows Azure code repositories on GitHub, 
                    you can &quot;Fork&quot; the code to your own account.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To get the source on your local development machine, 
                    simply clone the repo using Git:<br />
                    <code>git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/PROJECT.git<br />
                    git checkout dev</code>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Each repository has a README that should be helpful to 
                    learn more about the specifics of the language, project 
                    and its development environment.

                    on StackOverflow and MSDN. If your target language is .NET 
                    the most appropriate forums for discussion are on MSDN. 
                    
                    For all other languages please use StackOverflow.

                <p>
                    Feature requests and Design Change Requests (DCRs) are an important part of 
                    the lifecycle of any software project. Please log these as Issues in the 
                    appropriate GitHub repository.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although the team will consider any opened issues, please keep in mind 
                    that there is an extremely high bar when it comes to expanding the scope 
                    and functionality of a core product such as an SDK for Windows Azure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When opening any feature requests, consider including as much information 
                    as possible, including:

                    business or site will see from the feature.</li>
                    <li>Any design tips or estimation ideas you may have considered already.</li>
                    <li>Make note of whether you are opening an issue you would 
                    like the Microsoft team or another community member to work on <em>or</em> 
                    if you are looking to design &amp; develop the feature

                    Note that code submissions will be rigorously reviewed and 
                    tested by the Windows Azure SDK Team (or the appropriate

                    In some situations Microsoft employees may engage with you 
                    to review design decisions and mitigate issues as part of 
                    the contribution process. Understand that in some situations, 
                    developers inside Microsoft may decide to decline your 
                    pull request and instead log the issue for a future 
                    product milestone or bug fix. The team will provide 
                    information in the pull in these situations and still 
                    thank you for your contribution.
                </p>

                <p>
                      For bug fixes, simply start a conversation in the related 
                GitHub issue to notify the team and chat about the design of 
                the fix if needed.</p>

                 <p>
                    There are many opportunities to build value-add services and 
                     frameworks that do not need to direct alterations to the 
                     SDKs and products: NuGet packages for .NET or NPM modules 
                     for Node.js devs can easily take a dependency on the core 
                     SDK components, for example.

                  <h2>Step-by-step guide</h2>

                  <h4>Checkout the latest code</h4>
                  <p>In order to obtain the source code you need to become familiar
                    with Git (see <a href="http://progit.org/book/">http://progit.org/book/</a>)
                    and Github (see <a href="http://help.github.com/">http://help.github.com/</a>)
                    and you need to have Git installed on your local machine. You can
                    obtain the source code from Github and start a contributor environment by
                    following the these steps on your local machine:<br>
                  </p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Go to https://github.com/WindowsAzure/[PROJECT]</li>
                    <li>Select <img src="images/button-fork.jpg" alt=""> and choose your own Github account as target</li>
                    <li>Clone the repository on your local machine with the following
                      Git command<br>
                      <code>git clone git@github.com:[USERNAME]/[PROJECT]</code><br>
                    </li>
                    <li>When you clone the repository you should see, at least, 2 branches: dev and master.
                    dev is the branch where the team does all the day to day development while master is 
                    the branch that is always up to date with the latest release.<br/>
                    This means, before starting any work, you should switch to the dev branch. You can do so
                    with the following command:<br/>
                    <code>git checkout dev</code></li>
                  </ol>
                  <h4>Create bug fixes and features<br>
                  </h4>
                  <p>You can then start to make modifications to the code in your local Git repository.
                    This can be done in your local dev branch or, if you prefer, in a branch out of dev.
                    In the simplest scenario, working directly on dev, you can commit your work
                    with following commands:<br/>
                  </p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Add and commit your local changes<br/>
                      <code>git commit -a</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>Push your changes from your local repository to your github fork<br/>
                      <code>git push</code>
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>Once your code is in your github fork, you can then submit a pull request
                    for the team's review. You can do so with the following commands:<br/>
                  </p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>In GitHub click on the Pull
                      Request button <img src="images/button-pull-request.jpg" alt=""></li>
                    <li>In the pull request select your fork as source and
                      WindowsAzure/[PROJECT] as destination for the request</li>
                    <li>Write detailed message describing the changes in the pull
                      request</li>
                    <li>Submit the pull requst for consideration by the Core Team</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>If there are conflicts between your fork and the main project one, github
                    will warn you that the pull request cannot be merged. If that's the case,
                    you can do the following:
                  </p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Add remote to your local repository using the following Git

                      </code><code>git remote add upstream -f

                    </li>
                    <li>Update your local repository with the changes from the remote
                      repository by using the following Git commands (make sure you're in
                      the branch you're submitting the code from)<br>
                      <code>git merge upstream/dev</code></li>
                    <li>Resolve any conflicts locally and finally do another push with the command<br/>
                      <code>git push</code>
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>Please keep in mind that not all requests will be approved.
                    Requests are reviewed by the Core Team on a regular basis and will
                    be updated with the status at each review. If your request is
                    accepted you will receive information about the next steps and
                    when the request will be integrated in the main branch. If your

                <h2>Code Reviews</h2>
                <p>
                    The Windows Azure SDK team has an active Microsoft discussion 
                    group used for submitting code reviews and discussing design 
                    changes, best practices, and other important topics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Part of the code review process involves using a code review 
                    tool, and for most open source projects, the team uses the 
                    built-in Pull Request functionality on GitHub for enabling 
                    annotations and comments on code before accepting the pull 
                    request/s.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Expect a good amount of feedback as part of any pull request: 
                    not only which branch to merge to and from, but also 
                    consistency guidelines, matching existing code, and 
                    making targeted, smart changes when fixing bugs.
                </p>

                <h3>Community code reviews</h3>
                <p>
                    The SDK team is considering allowing for community code 
                    reviews as well. If you watch a repository of interest, 
                    you can make comments on any public pull request. The 
                    best time for providing feedback is during dev branch 
                    pulls into the primary WindowsAzure GitHub account.
